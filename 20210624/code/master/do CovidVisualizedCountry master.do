This file "do CovidVisualizedCountry master.do" was set up to be run from:
  |Users|local-user-name|Downloads|CovidVisualizedCountry-main|202YMMDD|code|master|do CovidVisualizedCountry master.do
  where 2021MMDD is the udpate date, e.g. update 20210624

If the first run does not go thru due to directory path clash, edit the contents within " " of the line _63_ or _65_ below, located beneath ****** set path based on local operating system ****** ,,, 
,,, to reflect the location of directory /CovidVisualizedCountry-main/ or \CovidVisualizedCountry-main\ on your local machine. Path should be:


global pathCovidVisualizedCountry "/Users/`usrnam'/Downloads/CovidVisualizedCountry-main/202YMMDD/code/" [for Mac]

global pathCovidVisualizedCountry = "C:\Users\\`usrnam'\Downloads\CovidVisualizedCountry-main\202YMMDD\code\" [for Windows]



It can be moved to and run from anywhere else as far as path requirements are adjusted.

/*

* On 20210824, the Imperial College COVID-19 model/study removed their "old fits" – 
all previously released updates from day 1 up to and including IMPE update 20210719 – 
from https://github.com/mrc-ide/global-lmic-reports/tree/master/data 

This means the Imperial College COVID-19 model/study is no more a periodically updated study with ACCESSIBLE updates – 
short of early retirement of the study. 

Several thousand lines of codes that used their previously released updates will not work.

The remedy for CovidVisualized repository https://github.com/pourmalek/CovidVisualizedCountry for the global level: 
is to comment out the command line reading csv data from https://github.com/mrc-ide/global-lmic-reports/tree/master/data.

* However, the previously stored results, such as:
the graphs stored in:
CovidVisualizedCountry-main/20210624/output/merge/*.pdf
and CovidVisualizedCountry-main/20210624/output/IMPE/*.pdf
preserve a graphical copy of previously accessed the Imperial College COVID-19 model/study removed updates.

* Data version of previously accessed Imperial College COVID-19 model/study removed updates are not stored in CovidVisualizedCountry repository 
due to very large file size. 
Removal of Imperial College COVID-19 model/study "old fits" hampers retrospective longitudinal assessment of the predictive performance of Imperial model, 
as a side effect or main effect.
