Epidemiological Data from the COVID-19 Outbreak in Canada

The COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group collects daily time series data on COVID-19 cases, deaths, recoveries, testing and vaccinations at the health region and province levels. Data are collected exclusively from publicly available sources including government reports and news media. Updates are made nightly between 21:30 and 22:00 ET. Our data collection is mostly automated; see Covid19CanadaETL and related projects for details.
